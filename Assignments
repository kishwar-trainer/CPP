Day 0::
1)Write a menu driven program to calculate are and circumference/perimeter of circle, square, triangle, 
  rectangle and print both results in main. Use const keyword for PI  (use pass by reference mechanism)
2)Write a program to calculate square, cube of number, max() to find maximum . Use inline functions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basics::
1) Write menu driven program in cpp to find 
area and perimeter for shapes(circle,square,rectangle)
Make use of function oveloading for area and perimeter

2)Write a program to get array of values and perform four arithmetic calculations based on 
enumerated values like PLUS, MINUS, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE.

3) Write  a  C++ program  with  a  function  repchar()  which  accepts  a  given 
char and a  numerical  value. The function when called will  print the given character for n times 
If  no  arguments  are  passed  to  the  function  it  will  print  *  for  5 times. 
Invoke the function with the following: 
i.	no arguments 
ii.	Single char argument 
iii.	Single int argument 
iv.	a char and an int argument

4)Write a program in C++ to calculate multiplication of 2nos. Or 3 nos. or 4 nos. as per user choice. (use default arguments)
5)Write a program to allocate memory in C++ for 2D array. Accept row and col size from  user and accept and display values.
6)Write a program to create an array dynamically and display it. 
    a)  An array size is accepted as a character and then converted to the integer using atoi. 
    b)  An array element is accepted as character and then converted to long using atoll. 
    c)  You can directly accept array size as integer, and array elements as long. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day2::
Classes->
1) Create a class Complex{int real,int imaginary }
   Implement default, parametrized constructor, display(), getter() and setter()
   Note:: The complex number displayed on screen should be in following format: 
    eg:: 2+3i  where, i is the imaginary unit used for only display purpose

2) Create a class Student{int iRoll; char cName[10]; float fPercentage; float marks[5];}
 Implement default, parametrized constructor, display(), getter() and setter() and
  any other functions if needed for calculating marks and percentage
 Note: every student may not appear all 5 exams. 

3)Create  a  class  for  time  consisting  hours,  minutes,  and  seconds  as data  members. 
 Methods should be used to initialize and display them.
  Develop a method to increment time by one second. 

4)Create a class Circle {int radius}
   Methods should be used to initialize and display area and circumference of circle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day3::
Operator Overloading::
1) Update class Complex to overload operators::
   +, -, *,/ , %
   ++, --
   < , > 
   +=, -=,
   != , ==
   << , >>

2) Update previously created class Time to add, subtract time and 
  increment(++) time by 1 minute (make sure the time is not invalid after increment)
  decrement(--) time by 1 minute.  Overload operators to perform above operations.
  Create a menu driven program to operate as per user's choice.
  Use cout and cin for I/O operations

3) Write a program to design class NTuple with members n1,n2,n3. Overload + operator for NTuple class.
(Eg. n1(1,2,3) n2(1,2,3)then o/p should be (1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3)= 1+4+9 = 14 )
Similarly implement for subtraction 

4)Create class Array {int size, int *arr}. Implement essential constructors.
  And overload operator << and >> to display and accept array values resp.
  Overload operator[] to access value of single index position
 Note: Make sure that the index position is not invalid

class Array
{
   int size,
   int *arr;
public:
   Array(int s)
   operator<<()
   operator>>()
   operator[]();
    ~Array();
};

int main()
{
    Array a1(5);
    cin >> a1
    cout << a1

    //value = a1.operator[](2);
    value = a1[2];   //operator[] function shoud return value of index 2
    a1[2] =100;      //this should replace value 100 on index 2
    
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 4::
Class String::
1) Create user-defined class string for following object creations::
    String s1;
    String s2("Hello");
    String s3(s2);
     String s4 = s2;
     String s5;
       s5 = s2;
       
     s2 = s2
     s1 = s2+s3  -->concatenation of strings
     s1[2]= 'L'    ->HeLlo
     cout<<s2[0]  -->O/P :: H  
   
     String s6("Good Morning");
     cout<<"substr:: "<<s3(5,11);    -->Morning
     Destrcutor
     s1 < s2
     cout << s1
     cin>>s1
     

2) Update class Array to implement destructor, copy constrctutor

3) Create class Matrix to allocate memory for 2D array as per user entered size for row and col
  overload operator() to fetch value from any index position
 eg:: Matrix m1(3,3) ; //2D array of size 3X3
       m1(1,2) = 100  //this should assign value 100 on index for array  mat[1][2]
    Note: Make sure that the index position is not invalid
