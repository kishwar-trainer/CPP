Day 0::
1)Write a menu driven program to calculate are and circumference/perimeter of circle, square, triangle, 
  rectangle and print both results in main. Use const keyword for PI  (use pass by reference mechanism)
2)Write a program to calculate square, cube of number, max() to find maximum . Use inline functions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basics::
1) Write menu driven program in cpp to find 
area and perimeter for shapes(circle,square,rectangle)
Make use of function oveloading for area and perimeter

2)Write a program to get array of values and perform four arithmetic calculations based on 
enumerated values like PLUS, MINUS, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE.

3) Write  a  C++ program  with  a  function  repchar()  which  accepts  a  given 
char and a  numerical  value. The function when called will  print the given character for n times 
If  no  arguments  are  passed  to  the  function  it  will  print  *  for  5 times. 
Invoke the function with the following: 
i.	no arguments 
ii.	Single char argument 
iii.	Single int argument 
iv.	a char and an int argument

4)Write a program in C++ to calculate multiplication of 2nos. Or 3 nos. or 4 nos. as per user choice. (use default arguments)
5)Write a program to allocate memory in C++ for 2D array. Accept row and col size from  user and accept and display values.
6)Write a program to create an array dynamically and display it. 
    a)  An array size is accepted as a character and then converted to the integer using atoi. 
    b)  An array element is accepted as character and then converted to long using atoll. 
    c)  You can directly accept array size as integer, and array elements as long.

Day2::
Classes->
1) Create a class Complex{int real,int imaginary }
   Implement default, parametrized constructor, display(), getter() and setter()
   Note:: The complex number displayed on screen should be in following format: 
    eg:: 2+3i  where, i is the imaginary unit used for only display purpose

2) Create a class Student{int iRoll; char cName[10]; float fPercentage; float marks[5];}
 Implement default, parametrized constructor, display(), getter() and setter() and
  any other functions if needed for calculating marks and percentage
 Note: every student may not appear all 5 exams. 

3)Create  a  class  for  time  consisting  hours,  minutes,  and  seconds  as data  members. 
 Methods should be used to initialize and display them.
  Develop a method to increment time by one second. 

4)Create a class Circle {int radius}
   Methods should be used to initialize and display area and circumference of circle
